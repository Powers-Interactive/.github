# Powers Interactive

We're a digital advertising company that builds its own internal operating system.

## Why We Build

Advertising operations at scale require speed, auditability, and tight coordination across teams. Off-the-shelf tools don't cut it. We build our own platform to create operational leverage.

## Platform

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Foundry** | Internal operating system for workflows, approvals, and execution |
| **Bedrock** | Data and analytics foundation — the canonical source of truth |
| **Atlas** | Intelligence layer built on Bedrock (broader than ads) |

## Architecture

```
Atlas (Intelligence)
        ↓
    Bedrock (Data)
        ↓
    Foundry (Operations)
```

Each layer builds on the one below. Bedrock provides the trusted data substrate. Foundry orchestrates day-to-day operations. Atlas synthesizes insights across the business.

## Team

This is internal infrastructure. If you're here, you're probably on the team.
